# Quantum Machine Learning for Sleep Apnea Detection

## üìå Project Overview
Sleep apnea is a serious medical condition characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and chronic fatigue if left untreated.  
The standard diagnostic method, **Polysomnography (PSG)**, is accurate but expensive, intrusive, and time-consuming.

This project explores a **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** approach for automated detection of sleep apnea using **EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals**.  
By combining classical signal processing with quantum machine learning, we aim to build a smarter, faster, and potentially more accurate method for detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
### Input
- EEG signals from the **PhysioNet MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database (SLPDB)**.
- Specifically, signals from the **C3-O1 EEG channel** sampled at 100‚Äì250 Hz.

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Noise removal and filtering of EEG signals.  
   - Segmentation into 30-second windows.  
   - Frequency-domain transformation (FFT) into brainwave bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma.  

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Statistical features: mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, RMS.  
   - Bandpower features: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma.  
   - Ratios and peak frequencies.  

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Implemented with **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** to identify the most relevant features.  

4. **Classification Models**
   - **Classical Machine Learning**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel.  
   - **Quantum Machine Learning**: Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using:
     - Qiskit (Quantum Kernel Estimation with ZZFeatureMap).  
     - PennyLane (AngleEmbedding + entanglement layers).  

5. **Output**
   - Binary classification: **Apnea** vs. **Normal sleep segment**.
